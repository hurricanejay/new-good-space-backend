The Good Space is a community platform that allows users to connect in a time of emergency. The web app is similar to Craigslist and allows users to view all community posts, create their own posts and respond directly to the author.

Motivation: With so much going on with COVID-19, there are a lot of people who are in need of help and others who can offer help. This app faciliates communication and connection to help foster a stronger community.

This is the backend of the app. To access to frontend, please see this link: https://github.com/hurricanejay/good-space-frontend
